	Last Monday, the U.S. Agency for International Development, in partnership with the Ad Council, launched a public awareness campaign called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.usaid.gov/FWD">FWD</a>&rdquo; &ndash; standing for Famine, War, Drought - to draw the attention to the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The campaign is calling on Americans to FWD the Facts.&nbsp; FWD them to your friends, FWD them to your neighbors, FWD them to everyone you know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A few of the facts:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
		More than 13 million people are in crisis &ndash; making this the largest humanitarian crisis in the world.</li>
<li>
		More than 700,000 people have fled from their homes in Somalia to Ethiopia and Kenya &ndash; creating the world&rsquo;s largest refugee camps.</li>
<li>
		1 child is dying every 6 minutes in Somalia.</li>
<li>
		More than 750,000 people are projected to perish from starvation in Somalia within the next four months if humanitarians are not allowed access in to southern Somalia.&nbsp;

 <title>A Call to Peace: Perspectives of Volunteers on the Peace Corps at 50</title>

	Since the Peace Corps was established in 1961, more than 200,000 Peace Corps volunteers have promoted world peace and friendship in 139 countries around the world. The stories of these Americans who have served are powerful, moving, and inspiring.</p>
<p>
	Civic Enterprises, the National Peace Corps Association and Peter D. Hart Research Associates recently collaborated to hear directly from Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs). Surveying over 11,000 RPCVs and leaders, &quot;<a href="http://www.civicenterprises.net/pdfs/a-call-to-peace.pdf">A Call to Peace: Perspectives of Volunteers on the Peace Corps at 50</a>&quot; (pdf) is the story of the individuals who shaped and defined the organization since its inception.</p>

 <title>Supporting Scientists at the Lab Bench ... and at Bedtime</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/26/supporting-scientists-lab-bench-and-bedtime-0</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>
	Ed note: This&nbsp;has been cross-posted&nbsp;from the Office of Science and Technology&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/26/supporting-scientists-lab-bench-and-bedtime">blog</a></p>
<p>
	Today is a good day for science and technology, a good day for scientists and engineers, and a good day for the nation.</p>
<p>
	As highlighted in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/helping-women-reach-their-economic-potential/2011/09/25/gIQA1dODxK_story.html">Washington Post op-ed</a>&nbsp;this morning, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is announcing a major, 10-year initiative to provide greater work-related flexibility to women and men in research careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Among other advances, the NSF&mdash;the Nation&rsquo;s major funder of research in engineering, computer science, mathematics, and other high-tech fields that will be central to U.S. economic growth in the years ahead&mdash;will allow researchers to delay or suspend their grants for up to one year in order to care for a newborn or newly adopted child or fulfill other family obligations.</p>
<p>
	That change and others being launched today at a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/26/white-house-and-national-science-foundation-announce-new-workplace-flexi">White House event</a>&nbsp;featuring First Lady Michelle Obama and NSF Director Subra Suresh aim to facilitate scientists&rsquo; reentry into their professions with minimal loss of momentum&mdash;especially women scientists, who, more often than not, are the ones who end up delaying or dropping their promising science careers because of competing family demands.</p>
<p>
	Today the White House also <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/26/president-obama-honors-outstanding-early-career-scientists">announced the winners</a>&nbsp;of the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE)&mdash;the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their research careers.</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s a great synergy between these two announcements because these up-and-coming researchers are tomorrow&rsquo;s all-stars in the making, and about 40 percent of them are women. The Nation needs all of these high-achievers, including all those women, to stick with their innovative work&mdash;to make the discoveries and design the technologies that will keep America the international science and technology powerhouse it is today.</p>
<p>
	Finally, special kudos to NSF and others in the Administration, including staff here at OSTP, for using the convening power of the White House and the Obama Administration to encourage businesses and academic and professional organizations to adopt policies similar to those that NSF is putting into place. Several are today announcing ambitious efforts in coordination with NSF&rsquo;s announcement. &nbsp;A list of them is available <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/nsf_career_life_commitments_factsheet_final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
